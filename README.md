# Leading Cause of Death in New York
Practicing how to use React and D3 together, as it's a bit different from using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as React and D3 both handle DOM manipulation.
Using dataset of leading cause of death in New York from 2014-2017, found in Kaggle.

Priority is to first let React handle all the DOM manipulation and use D3's powerful methods to generate the SVGs and directly input them into the SVG elements. 
Also, used JavaScript's ResizeObserver to dynamically render the charts as the height and width changes, making the graphs / charts responsive.
